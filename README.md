# beryl-game-engine
This game engine was built on the LWJGL graphics library.
It is currently unfinished, and only contains enough features 
to use on on my future project using this engine.
I followed [this tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE) for 
most of it, but added a few of my own features as well.
The demo test just features a square that follows the cursor 
as it moves across the window.

Things that I plan to add:
  - Textures
  - Sounds
  - Better documentation
